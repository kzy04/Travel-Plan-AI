Our stay was at Andromeda Beach Resort, a rural yet photogenic resort. We rented scooters for 2000 taka per day for 24 hours. For food, we had dinner at Palanki Restaurant near the resort. The food included fried fulko luchi in ghee, rice, dal stuffing, and Paturi, though the food quality didn’t match the price.
Breakfast at the resort was complimentary, with items like dal, roti, and fried eggs. We explored the private beach in front of the resort, and later went on a ride to Marine Drive. We also visited Shamlapur and enjoyed the scenic views and adventurous roads.

Food:
We had a meal at a local restaurant where the total cost for five people was ৳2275, including curd, tea, and other items.
Special dishes included roasted khichdi, beef curry, and large paratha. The khichdi was made with capsicum, and the beef was highly recommended.
A visit to a beach restaurant offered a variety of seafood: dal, shrimp, crab fry, crab masala, eggplant stuffing, Rupchada fry, and chicken masala.
The shrimp was served with coriander leaves, adding to the flavor, and the fish was fried before being added to the broth.
The restaurant's food quality and variety were appreciated, with an excellent view enhancing the dining experience.
