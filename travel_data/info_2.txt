I am traveling to Rajshahi, one of the famous locations in Bangladesh during mango season. In this video, you'll see the experience of having mangoes straight from the trees and the hyped restaurant of Rajshahi, "Kutumbari." We will also enjoy "Lebur Pinik" and "Kalai Ruti" for dinner.
We started for Rajshahi on 8 June around 4 pm. After crossing the Jamuna bridge, we reached Rajshahi city after almost 6 hours of journey. We headed towards a mango field, about 10-15 minutes from Tukiya City. The mangoes here were Fazli, and we enjoyed eating ripe mangoes directly from the tree. We even had jackfruit after the mangoes.
Next, we went to "Kutumbari" at Marmaria Bazar in Rajshahi for lunch. We enjoyed a delicious meal of duck, chicken, rice, daal, and vorta, with duck costing 150 TK. The food was flavorful, tender, and well-cooked. We also had a great experience at Sopura Silk, where we bought a silk saree.
Later, we went on a street food tour in Rajshahi. We tried puri with "piyaju" (fritters) at "Aam Chattar," where each cost only 2 TK. After that, we visited Rajshahi University to try "Lebur Chur" and "Lebur Pinik" (spicy lemon snacks). The combination of masala, nimki, chili, and lemon was refreshing and flavorful.

Today we visited 5 new places inside Dhaka where you can roam without eating. We started at the Bangabandhu Military Museum, which charges 100 taka per person for entry. Tickets must be purchased online. The museum offers a lot of historical insights, especially related to the military. It’s a great place for children and adults to learn about our history. After the museum, we went to the 3D Art World, where the art comes to life, and you can take pictures from various angles. The ticket for this place is 200 taka per person.
Next, we visited Toggi Fun World at Bashundhara City, which costs 300 taka per person. It offers a variety of rides, including VR experiences, bowling, and virtual football. We spent some time there, but it’s quite expensive. If you plan to visit, checking the menu or choosing a package might be more cost-effective.
Lastly, we went to Upside Down in Uttara, which also has a location in Dhanmondi. It’s another fun place to visit in Dhaka.
