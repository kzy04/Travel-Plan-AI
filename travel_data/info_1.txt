Travel Information:
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We are traveling to this forest and staying at a beautiful eco-resort.
We started our journey from Dhaka at 7:30 AM. The journey from Dhaka to Mongla takes around four hours. We took a break for breakfast at Gopalganj after crossing the Mawa Padma Bridge.
After reaching Mongla, we parked our cars near the ferry pier, with a parking charge of 500 taka. From there, we took a boat for about an hour and a half to reach our resort. The boat journey was along the Pashur River and then through the Dhaing Mari Canal, surrounded by forests and wildlife.
Upon arrival at the eco-resort, we received welcome drinks. The resort offers different types of rooms, such as the Golpata view room, canal view room, and Rain Castle. Each room has a balcony and a relaxing environment.
Food Information:
Breakfast at Gopalganj included paratha, fried egg, dal, khichuri, and beef. Tea and machine coffee were also available.
At the resort, lunch was served buffet-style, including local fish, gourd shrimp, potato stew, banana stew, local chicken curry, salad, and white rice. Special shrimp and roast were available separately. A clay jug was used for water.
Coffee was made in the evening, and the bird sounds around the resort created a relaxing atmosphere.
There's another road behind us with villages. In front, across the water, lies the Sundarbans. The road is beautiful, with every house having its own shop. We are walking in a completely rural environment, surrounded by birds. The road here is similar to St. Martin’s village, with small ponds on both sides. The cold weather makes this season the best for exploring the Sundarbans, keeping us fresh despite a long journey.
We arrived at a resort where evening snacks included noodles and vegetable pakoras. The restaurant looked beautiful at night with lighting. Dinner included luchi, chicken barbecue, dal, and salad. We also had coral fish barbecue, which was well-cooked with perfect marination. The smoky flavor of the chicken was delicious.
In the morning, we took a boat ride in the Sundarbans. The boat was stable and could carry up to 12-13 people. We saw keora and bynda trees along the way. The dense forest and canals created a mesmerizing scene.
Breakfast included roasted khichuri, fried brinjal, fried eggs, cucumber-green chili salad, and pickles, served hot. The room package included breakfast, lunch, dinner, evening snacks, boat rides, and transport from Mongla Ferry to the resort. Room rates varied from ৳11,000 to ৳12,000 per night for two people, with an additional charge for extra guests. A dormitory-style room for groups of up to 10 people cost ৳2,500 per person, including all services.
On our way back, we visited a crocodile sanctuary, where we saw a large crocodile basking in the sun. We also spotted dolphins at the estuary, which appeared briefly in the water.
At the hot water Sundarbans, we explored the area after checkout. Entry tickets cost ৳46 per person. Inside, there were maps of the Sundarbans and a wildlife sanctuary with crocodiles, deer, and monkeys.
Finally, after an hour of exploring, we boarded a boat back to Mongla Ferry Ghat, concluding our two-day Sundarbans trip. This short trip provided many new experiences.

We are traveling around Narsingdi district today, just a short trip from Dhaka. Our first stop is at a shop in Nila Market, Purbachal, for breakfast. We had paratha with dal, vegetables, and a spicy beef patty. After breakfast, we enjoyed tea from a local shop. The area is quieter in the morning but bustling later.
On our way to Narsingdi, we passed the Kanchan Bridge toll plaza. The road was slightly bumpy but good overall, and the journey took about an hour. We parked near the bridge and continued our trip. Our first spot in Narsingdi is the Sunflower Garden, which has an entry fee of 30 taka. There’s also a combined ticket for both the sunflower and tulip gardens for 50 taka. After enjoying the sunflowers, we visited a nearby restaurant where we had fuchka and ice cream.
The Sunflower Garden is located on the banks of the Meghna River, providing a beautiful setting for photos. The best time to visit for pictures is between 10 AM and 12 PM. We also visited a play area for children and a restaurant near the ticket counter that offers light snacks like fuchka and coffee.
We paid a 50 taka parking fee and 350 taka entry ticket for Dream Holiday Park, which is very close to Dhaka, only about 15 minutes from the Sunflower Garden. The park is huge and has lakes, a beautiful setting, and various attractions. Inside, there's a Universal Studios-style elephant, a map, and plenty of areas to explore. The park is a popular spot for picnics, especially for corporate groups and families. There are a few snack shops, and the place is well-marked with arrows for easy navigation.
We had a rooster pola (chicken curry with rice), which was soupy and tasty. The price was 300 taka. There's a crowded restaurant inside serving biryani and chicken curry, which we also tried. After eating, we visited the "ghost house," which had fun photo opportunities and a cool vibe. The park features a cable car ride costing 110 taka per person, offering a great view of the entire park. We also tried the speedboat ride, costing 130 taka per person, but it felt rushed.
In the park, there are beautiful fountains, flower arrangements, and a Sky Train ride. The speedboat ride near the Padma Bridge theme was also a highlight. We didn’t find many famous local food spots in Narsingdi but will retur

Today, we are going to Dera Resort in Manikganj, about 70 kilometers from Dhaka. We just crossed the Gaptoli bus stand and are heading toward the Savar-Manikganj highway. The road is rough but beautiful with fields and green rural surroundings. We will be arriving in Manikganj city in about 20 minutes. The resort is fully booked, so check-in is at 2 pm.

After crossing the club bridge, there are many activity zones like hiking, horse riding, zip lining, and beach bike zones. These activities are not included with the room and have a separate charge.
In the afternoon, we took a buggy ride, enjoying the cold breeze. The superior lake view room has a separate balcony, and the cottages with shared balconies are larger, with four rooms around a central sitting area.
The resort is vast, covering over 350 places, and there is a recreation center with adventure activities like rope climbing. We also visited the hanging bridge, which offers a beautiful view of the resort.
Dinner is served buffet style with many items, and you can also order separately from the menu. The buffet had fried rice, chow mein, grilled fish, pilaf crab, and beef chili onion. We found the fish fillet and beef chili onion to be the best, while the fries were a bit hard. The dessert section lacked pastry items, but there was sweet yogurt and some pithas.
Breakfast included paratha, chicken curry, vegetables, dal, sausage, French toast, and two types of juice (papaya and orange). The breakfast was good, though the dessert selection was limited.

We arrived at the resort, and the staff delivered our drinks to the room. We went to the beach to enjoy the sunset. The sky turned red, and the clouds looked like cotton.
